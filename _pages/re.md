### Sequence modeling in content delivery with time-varying popularity

Time-variability of popular contents in communication networks necessitate the efficient utilization of resources to achieve a reliable and timely delivery of contents. During my PhD studies, I modeled the dynamism in the popular content using Markov process and then I studied the effect of different delivery schemes such as proactive or reactive resource utilization on the latency performance of system. The results are published in the following peer-reviewed articles:

### Parallel processing using map-reduce computation

Running computationally intensive tasks by a mobile agent/device suffers from large delay and inefficient  resource utilization. In this project, I studied parallelizing the computation task using map-reduce approach while providing different service levels. The result is published in the following conference:

### Resource management using game theoretic analysis

In communication networks, service providers and end-users have contradicting goals. The former seeks to attain the highest income per provided resource while the latter attempts to obtain the lowest price per service. Using game theoretic analysis, I modeled the interaction between the service providers and end-users using competition or collaboration based schemes. The results are published in the following peer-reviewed articles:
