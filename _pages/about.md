I received PhD in electrical engineering from [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.njit.edu) at [New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://www.njit.edu)(NJIT) in Spring 2018. My research focus was on utilizing *information theory* and *optimization methods* to enhance the quality of experience in wireless networks. I was honored to work under supervision of Prof. [Osvaldo Simeone](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/osvaldo.simeone/index.htm) in [Center for Wireless Information Processing](http://centers.njit.edu/cwcspr/) at NJIT. I was also delighted to work with Prof. [Ravi Tandon](http://www2.engr.arizona.edu/~tandonr/) from the University of Arizona.    

I presented the results of my research at [2016 Annual Conference on Information Science and Systems (CISS)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7460543/) in [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu) and [2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7841853/). My complete publication list is available in (Google Scholar Profile)[https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=de&user=Nuew5tYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works].
