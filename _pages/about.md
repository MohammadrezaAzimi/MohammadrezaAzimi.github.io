I received PhD in electrical engineering from [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.njit.edu) at [New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://www.njit.edu)(NJIT) in Spring 2018. I was honored to work under supervision of Prof. [Osvaldo Simeone](https://nms.kcl.ac.uk/osvaldo.simeone/index.htm) in [Center for Wireless Information Processing](http://centers.njit.edu/cwcspr/) at NJIT. I was also delighted to work with Prof. [Ravi Tandon](http://www2.engr.arizona.edu/~tandonr/) from the University of Arizona. I received Hashimoto fellowship from NJIT in 2016. My research interests include information theory, machine learning, deep learning and stochastic analysis of usersâ€™ demand in caching systems.
