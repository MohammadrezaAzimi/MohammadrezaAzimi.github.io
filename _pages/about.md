I got PhD from [Center for Wireless Information Processing](http://centers.njit.edu/cwcspr/), [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.njit.edu) at [New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://www.njit.edu)(NJIT) in Spring 2018. My research focus was on utilizing *information theory* and *optimization methods* to enhance the quality of experience in wireless networks. I was honored to work under supervision of Prof. [Osvaldo Simeone](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/informatics/people/atoz/SimeoneO.aspx). I was also delighted to work with Prof. [Ravi Tandon](http://www2.engr.arizona.edu/~tandonr/) from the university of Arizona.
