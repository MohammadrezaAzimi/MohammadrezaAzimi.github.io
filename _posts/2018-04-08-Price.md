### Project description

Input: Training and test sets are comprised of 404 and 102 samples, respectively.  Each sample is a function of 13 features such as crime rate, tax, etc.

Goal: Predicting the median price of homes in a given Boston suburb in the mid-1970s.

Network model: It is shown in the following figure:

Details: Optimization of stochastic gradient descent algorithm is done using RMSProp. Mean absolute value is performance metric and mean square error is the loss function. K-fold cross-validation (K=4) is used.         

Result is shown the following figure:

Modification:

Since the validation MAE stops improving after 80 epochs, the model is trained only for 80 epochs and then is used for prediction.
