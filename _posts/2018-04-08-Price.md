* Project description:
Input: Training and test sets are comprised of 404 and 102 samples, respectively.  Each sample is a function of 13 features such as crime rate, tax, etc.

Network model: It is shown in the following figure:

Details: Optimization of stochastic gradient descent algorithm is done using RMSProp. Mean absolute value is performance metric and mean square error is the loss function. K-fold cross-validation (K=4) is used.         

Here are the tips for implementation:

Result is shown the following figure:

* Modification:

Since the validation MAE stops improving after 80 epochs, the model is trained only for 80 epochs and then is used for prediction.   

The source code of this project is available in my [Github page](https://github.com/MohammadrezaAzimi/House-Price-Regression-NN). Interested reader is referred to the book *Deep Learning with Python* by Francois Chollet.
