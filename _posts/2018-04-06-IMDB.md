* Project description:
In this project, there are 25000 highly polar movie reviews for training and development (hold-out) sets while there is a test set of 25000 reviews.     

* Network model: A three-layer neural network is used. The network is comprised of two fully-connected layers with 16 hidden units and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation as well as the output layer with sigmoid activation that classifies the reviews as positive or negative. The network is shown in the following figure:

* Implementation: The project is written in Python language using TensorFlow library as backend and Keras package.

* Details: Optimization of stochastic gradient descent algorithm is done using RMSProp. Accuracy is performance metric and binary cross_entropy is the loss function.    

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```
R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```

inline `x+y`.
