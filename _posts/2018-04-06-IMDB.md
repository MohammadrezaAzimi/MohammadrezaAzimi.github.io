* Project description:
In this project, there are 25000 highly polar movie reviews for training and development (hold-out) sets while there is a test set of 25000 reviews.     

* Network model: A three-layer neural network is used. The network is comprised of two fully-connected layers with 16 hidden units and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation as well as the output layer with sigmoid activation that classifies the reviews as positive or negative. The network is shown in the following figure:

* Implementation: The project is written in Python language using TensorFlow library as backend and Keras package.

* Details: Optimization of stochastic gradient descent algorithm is done using RMSProp. Accuracy is performance metric and binary cross_entropy is the loss function.    

Here are the tips for implementation:

1. Only 10000 most frequently words in the training set are kept.
2. Using Python code ``` imdb.get_word_index()``` words are mapped to integer indices. Then a dictionary is constructed using ```dict()```.
3. To prepare the data, integer indices are transformed to tensors using one-hot encoding.
4. The network is build as above figure.
5. Setting the batch size equal to 512 and fitting the training data to the model over 20 epochs, results in the following figures for loss and accuracy.
