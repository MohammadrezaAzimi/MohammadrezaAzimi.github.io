* Project description:
In this project, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network is designed. The dataset is CIFAR10. Generator takes a random vector from the latent space and map it to a synthesized image. A discriminator maps the image to a binary score that is the probability of being fake/real image. Both generator and discriminator are deep convnets. The generator is trained to fool the discriminator.         

* Generator: It is comprised of a fully connected layer followed by a conv layer and then a deconv layer and finally three conv layers. The deconv layer is used to upsample the low dimensional latent space sample to the size of original image. The activation of all intermediate layer is Leaky ReLU to relax the sparsity constraint. The activation of last layer is tanh.

* Discriminator: Four conv layers with stride of size 2 are used for downsampling. The result is flattened as a vector. Then, dropout is defined to add randomness. Finally, output layer with sigmoid activation is used.      

* The model is trained by generating fake images produced by generator, mixing them with real images and adding a small random noise to their corresponding labels.  

* The grid of decoded images are shown as follows which are difficult to distinguish:
