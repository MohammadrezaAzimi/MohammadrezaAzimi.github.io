#### Project description:
Input: MNIST dataset

Encoder: It maps an input image to a mean and variance of a normal distribution in the image latent space with low dimension.

Decoder: Generate a sample drawn from the normal distribution with given mean and variance to  reconstruct the original image.

Network model: For both encoder and decoder the models are shown as following:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/VAE/Slide1.jpg" alt="ooo">

After training the model, decoder is  used to map the sampled points of latent space to images.

The grid of decoded images are shown as follows:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/VAE/mnist.png" alt="ooo">
