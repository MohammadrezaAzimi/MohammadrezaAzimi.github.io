* Project description:
In this project, there are 4000 labeled images as cat and dog. The set is divided into training, validation and test sets of 1000, 500 and 500 examples of each class, respectively.

* Implementation: The project is written in Python language using TensorFlow library as backend and Keras package.

* A pretrained convolutional neural network known as VGG16 is used to extract features of each image in the small set of cat and dogs. The network of VGG16 is shown in the following figure:

* After extracting features of all images in the dataset, they are fed into a fully connected layer of 256 hidden units. Dropout with probability of 0.5 is used for the fully connected layer and then the result is fed to output layer with sigmoid activation. Since original VGG16 was introduced for ImageNet problem with 1000 classes, the last layer is changed and the code is as follows:

```
conv_base=VGG16(weights='imagenet',include_top='False',input_shape=(150,150,3))
```

* The resulting loss and accuracy are shown in the following figures:

* Modification: To increase the accuracy, data augmentation is used to obtain more training data. The code is
```
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
      rotation_range=40,
      width_shift_range=0.2,
      height_shift_range=0.2,
      shear_range=0.2,
      zoom_range=0.2,
      horizontal_flip=True,
      fill_mode='nearest')
```
* Resulting loss and accuracy are shown in the following figures:
