### Problem Description:

Let consider the following table that shows the grade of students for different courses:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/top/table.png" alt="ooo">      

The question is how the grades can be sorted in the descending order for each student. The desired output should be as follows:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/top/table2.png" alt="ooo">

### Solution:

If one wants to sort records based on only one course, let say Physics, she can write the following SQL query in Postgres:

```
SELECT *
FROM
  grades
ORDER BY Physics  DESC
```   
As a result, top grades for Physics course are sorted in the descending order.

To obtain the desired solution, first a temporary table should be created and then the grades will be sorted in the descending order. Since for loop cannot be used in SQL queries to find each of the grades and store them in different columns, similar queries with different offsets are used. The following query hence can be used:

```
SELECT *,

(SELECT Max(x)
        FROM (VALUES (Biology),(Physics),(Calculus)) AS Y(x) ) AS highest_grade
,
(SELECT x
        FROM (VALUES (Biology),(Physics),(Calculus)) AS Y(x) ORDER BY x DESC OFFSET 1 ROWS FETCH next 1 ROWS ONLY ) AS second_highest_grade,
(SELECT x
        FROM (VALUES (Biology),(Physics),(Calculus)) AS Y(x) ORDER BY x DESC OFFSET 2 ROWS FETCH next 1 ROWS ONLY ) AS third_highest_grade

FROM
(SELECT *
FROM grades) AS T
```
