* Project description:
In this project, there are 8982 news that belong to 46 mutually exclusive categories. Training and development (hold-out) sets are constructed from theses examples. The first 1000 news are kept as the development set while the rest is used for training set. There is an additional test set of 2246 news.     

* Network model: A three-layer neural network is used. The network is comprised of two fully-connected layers with 64 hidden units and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation as well as the output layer with softmax activation that classifies the news as one of the 46 classes. The network is shown in the following figure:

* Implementation: The project is written in Python language using TensorFlow library as backend and Keras package.

* Details: Optimization of stochastic gradient descent algorithm is done using RMSProp. Accuracy is performance metric and categorical_crossentropy is the loss function.    

Here are the tips for implementation:

1. Only 10000 most frequently words in the training set are kept.
2. Using Python code ``` reuters.get_word_index()``` words are mapped to integer indices. Then a dictionary is constructed using ```dict()```.
3. To prepare the data, integer indices are transformed to tensors using one-hot encoding. In Keras, the built-in function `to_categorical()` is defined for this purpose.   
4. The network is build as above figure.
5. Setting the batch size equal to 512 and fitting the training data to the model over 20 epochs, results in the following figures for loss and accuracy.

* Modification:

1. To combat the overfitting problem, early stoppage is used and the training is done only for 9 epochs. The resulting accuracy is 0.8.
